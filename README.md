# Socket.IO Chat

Extension of the previous chat app using Socket.io.

## To run this app, point to the folder and

```
$ npm ci
$ npm start
```

And point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. 

## Features I have added

- Multiple users can join a chat room by each entering a unique username
on website load.
- Users can type chat messages to the chat room.
- A notification is sent to all users when a user joins or leaves
the chatroom.
